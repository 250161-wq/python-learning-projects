# Here we are going to replace  pineapple instead of apple in fruits list when we first type  variable and then inside the brackets we type a number 0 , that means first item of the list and  we can even change that number  to any number at list for example , in python we start with number 0 and so , number  0 means "apple", number 1 means "orange", number 2 means "banana" and number 3 means "coconut"  and when we type number 0 that means we are going to change "apple" to "pineapple"
